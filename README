This is a simple server that I did out of curiosity. I was aiming at the web.whatsapp authentication method

So, basicaly this is a server that connects with the user using a socket from socket.io 
Them, proceds to shuffle it, and them show it to the user as an QRCode

I also made a react native aplication to read that qrcode, using the smartphone camera
When it reads the qrcode, it sends a request to the server using axios to make a connection in url/connect/request?connection= + code read"

Them, when this happens the server loops through all the sockest that are connected and, if the code exists is sends to the page the message "sucess"

I used heroku to make the code work, you can check it out on https://myapp-worldagenda.herokuapp.com/
