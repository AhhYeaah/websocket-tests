This is a simple server that I did out of curiosity. I was aiming at the web.whatsapp authentication method

So, basicaly this is a server that connects with the user using a socket from socket.io 
Them, proceds to shuffle it, and them show it to the user as an QRCode

I also made a react native aplication to read that qrcode, using the smartphone camera
When it reads the qrcode, it sends a request to the server using axios to make a connection in url/connect/request?connection= + code read"

Them, when this happens the server loops through all the sockest that are connected and, if the code exists is sends to the page the message "sucess"

I used heroku to make the code work, you can check it out on https://myapp-worldagenda.herokuapp.com/

I know that you dont have the app, but, you can simply do what the app does if you use https://myapp-worldagenda.herokuapp.com/connect/
Keep in mind that for everything to work, the page containing the qrcode must be openned.

1) You will have to right click on the page, inspect elements
2) Then go to the div called qrcode, click it and them you will see the code that you will need, copy it
3) OPEN ANOTHER TAB, DONT CLOSE THE QRCODE TAB.
4) Get to https://myapp-worldagenda.herokuapp.com/connect/
5) Paste the code and click on enter

If the code is right it will make an alert on the qr page, if its not, them it will infinitly load.

EDIT: you cant do that anymore, soon i will upload the app code to github so you can test it if you want to
